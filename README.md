# Zillow-SciKitLearn-MEC471
MEC 471 final project work

I did not actually end up using scikitlearn as the Kmeans clustering, bootstraping and stepwise OLS functionality needed in my approach were all more easily avaible in Stata. Stata is the standard statistics software package in the department so I think it is most productive for my peers to maintain a Stata only workflow.


The data set includes k = 50 clusters. One cluster was made with out inclusion of sale price real and the other cluster was formed with the included sale price real.
