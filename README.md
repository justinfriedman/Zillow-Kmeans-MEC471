# Zillow-Kmeans-MEC471
MEC 471 final project work

Stata is the standard statistics software package in the department so I think it is most productive for my peers to maintain a Stata only workflow. I was able to utlize the built in Kmeans clustering, bootstraping and stepwise OLS functionality in Stata to complete my analysis. 


The data set includes k = 5 clusters.
